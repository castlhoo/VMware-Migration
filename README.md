## vMotion Overview

vMotion is a powerful feature provided by VMware that enables live migration of virtual machines (VMs) from one physical host to another without any downtime. This seamless migration ensures that business-critical applications remain available without interruption during maintenance or resource balancing.

## vMotion Features

- **Zero Downtime**: Migrates VMs without service interruption, ideal for routine server maintenance.
- **Resource Optimization**: Enables dynamic balancing of resources across servers by moving VMs between hosts to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **Flexibility**: Supports both intra-cluster and cross-cluster migrations.

## How vMotion Works

![vMotion Process Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f10986d7-d9bc-4a00-a3a6-cfac912eb0e4)
![vMotion Process Step 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b948895-7fc0-4257-9365-a516b9036213)

1. **Shadow VM Creation**: A Shadow VM is created on the target host with the same configuration as the source VM.

2. **Pre-copy Phase**: The memory and running state of the source VM are copied in real-time to the Shadow VM.

3. **Memory Synchronization**: As copying nears completion, the source VM continues to run until there are very few changed memory pages.

4. **Final Copy**: The source VM is briefly paused, and remaining memory pages are copied to the target host.

5. **VM Restart and Network Connection**: The VM is restarted on the target host, and network connections are established.

6. **Minimal Ping Loss**: The VM's downtime is extremely short, resulting in ping loss of about 1â€“2 ms, which is almost imperceptible to clients.

## Requirements for vMotion

1. **Shared Storage**

3. **CPU Compatibility**

## vMotion Setup Guide

### 1. Add Port Group in Distributed Switch for vMotion Network

### 4. Migration

![Migration Types](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d825a87d-69ef-4997-a62e-ea818152dfb3)
![Migration Process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdcaf736-f6ca-40d1-99a7-2710bf01727c)

Four types of migration:
1. Compute resource (basic live migration)
2. Change storage only
3. Combined compute resource and storage migration
4. Migration between vCenter servers

## vMotion EVC

Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) allows vMotion between hosts with different CPU generations.

![EVC Concept](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b346d2e6-0296-4bf6-b8d8-3ecfe1f54186)

### Advantages and Disadvantages of EVC

**Advantages:**
- Supports various CPU types
- Allows gradual upgrades without purchasing all CPUs at once

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited to CPUs that pass the compatibility check
- Cannot fully utilize the newest CPU features on hosts with the latest CPUs

### EVC Setup

1. Check Compatibility Guide
